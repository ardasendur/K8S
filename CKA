Core Concepts
Master Node : 
 - > etcd (DB of cluster)
 - > kube api server (external user operation)
 - > kube-scheduler
 - > controller-manager (node-controller , replication controller)
 Master : plan,schedule,control and manage 
 Worker Node: 
  -> kubelet ( kube api server talk with kubelet)
  -> kube-proxy (provide communication between nodes)
  -> Container run time (docker ,rocket)

 ETCD:
  - key-value store 
   Install ETCD
      Download binaries : curl -L https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/download/v3.3.11/etcdv3.3.11-linux-amd64.tar.gz -o etcd-v3.3.11-linux-amd64.tar.gz
      Extract : tar xzvf etcd-v3.3.11-linux-amd64.tar.gz
      Run ETCD Service : ./etcd - 
   - > Nodes, Pods, Configs,Secrets,Accounts,Roles,Bindings,Others information store in etcd
   - > Every info whenever you call kubectl get command is from etcd server.
   - > default port for etcd is : 2379
   - > You can install etcd two ways : manual or kubeadm
  Kubernetess Api Server: 
    1- Auth user
    2- Validate request
    3- Retrieve data
    4- Update ETCD
    5- Scheduler (continiously monitors api server and realize that any pods with no assigned nodes)
    6- Kubelet
    7- ETCD update
To summarize: the kube api-server is responsible for Authenticating and validating request,retriving data
In fact kube api server is the only component that interacts directly with etcd datastore 
View api-server opitons : cat /etc/kubernetess/manifest/kube-apiserver.yaml
ps aux | grep kube-apiserver

Kube Controller Manager : 
 - A controller is a process that continiously monitos the state of various components within the system
 - Node controller is responsible for monitoring the status of the nodes and taking necassary action (keep application runnig)
 - Replication controller is responsible to hold the system desired state.
 
- kubeadm does not deploy  kubelets
Kube Proxy: 
Each node in kubernetess cluster can reach any other nodes in cluster.
If the app is exposed with servie, they can talk with the name of the service
